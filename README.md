<h2>Learn C++ - Notes by Shoe</h2>
<p>Hello everyone! I just wanted to commit some notes I've been taking on the basics of C++. All of the notes come from the video "Learn C++ in One Video" by Derek Banas, found on YouTube.</p>

<p>These notes are variations of his and I do not claim that they are my own. This in mind, I publicize these notes with the aim that it may help someone. If not, it's a good reference for myself.</p>

<p>If you feel that I can improve somehow, feel free to reach out to me and let me know. However, these are simply notes on the introductionary concepts to C++ and aren't meant to be God-tier notes on how intricate C++ is.</p>

<b>Enjoy!</b>
